## Features
### Card Flipping Animation:
Clicking a card flips it to reveal its image, with smooth transitions and a shake animation for mismatches.
### Matching Logic: 
Players try to find pairs of matching cards. When two cards match, they stay flipped; if not, they flip back after a shake effect.
### Shuffle Functionality: 
The cards are shuffled at the start and after all pairs are matched, ensuring a random layout each game.
### Responsive Design: 
The game board and card sizes adjust for different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) using media queries.
### Win Condition: 
When all pairs are matched, the game automatically reshuffles for a new round.
### Visual Effects: 
Uses Google Fonts, box shadows, rounded corners, and color themes for a modern look.
### User Interaction Handling:
Prevents flipping more than two cards at once and disables interaction during animations.
